### Solves the question: "Who can I put on this project?"
Whether it's in construction, software development, meeting planning, or scheduling the wedding singer, one of the biggest risks for a service business is taking on more work than you can handle, or having too many employees charging to your overhead.

Project Bullpen allows users to create a roster of employees (resources) and a list of projects/leads, assign those employees to projects, and view the projects with their resources on a timescale.  From this, companies can:

* Analyze their current resources against current projects or potential opportunities/leads.
* Determine, on a timescale, where all resources are deployed, where additional resources are needed (new hires), or where too many resources are "riding the bench."
